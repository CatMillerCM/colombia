# Pool Request

Welcome to Colombia's project: Pool Request.

Colombia was a country full of colour, culture and adorable creatures, but one aspect that really made my trip was the people I met and the time spent with them. Whether it was in a beach bar, at a sociable hostel, or in a countryside town's square, there always seemed to be a game of pool ready to commence.

With so many friends wanting to get involved, it was common to play a slightly different take on Cutthroat Pool, where each player would receive a secret batch of ball numbers to attempt to keep safe on the table. Most of the time this would involve tediously writing numbers on napkins and ripping up tiny morsels to distribute.

Well, Pool Request solves this issue - making it easy to have each player's numbers secretly assigned.

While the app itself is very basic, I wanted to focus on ensuring each component and util was thoroughly tested and that the code base was clean and consistent, using React Testing Library, ESlint, Stylelint and PostCSS.
